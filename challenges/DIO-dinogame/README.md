# Dinossaur Game

## About

This is a simple project based on the T-Rex Runner game. This project was part of the Bootcamp offered by GFT on the Digital Innovation One platform, and was guided by Celso Henrique.

## Customization

I added a button to replay the game after game over and also added a score. For the template, I  used [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io) framework.

## Demo

You can see the project running at:

## About

A small game Memory Match Card Game based on Street Fighter II characters.

## How to play

The game consists in flip all the card over the board finding the matching card. 

Use your mouse to click on the cards and try to find the match card. You win after finding all the matchs.

## Goals

This project was based on another card match game, but I improve some new functions.

As the name suggests, it was written in JavaScript.

```javascript
let you = (enjoy, the, game) => {
    console.log('Enjoy!');
}
```
